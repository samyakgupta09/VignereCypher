# VignereCypher

In this project, I implement the vignere cypher to decrypt files with unknown keys. 

## Problem Setting

* Vignere cypher uses a keyword which is repeated until it matches the length of plain text creating a keystream.
* This keystream is then used to encrypt each letter in the plain text.
* The program finds the keyword, given the length of the keyword and decrypts the message.

## Tech Stack
* Python
* Libraries used: math

## How to run
* Run a2.py and input the file to be decrypted.
